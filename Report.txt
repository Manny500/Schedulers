Besides the code to your scheduler please submit the following Report:

1. A short introduction to the problem you are trying to solve.

2. A description of the how each of the scheduling methods work, including your hybrid one.

3. A description of your code design and your choice of data structures.
4. Correctness Results - In this section you should present the results for each scheduler in the following way:

	a. Show a small input file (around 4 processes).
	b. Manually draw a Gantt Chart to represent the scheduling.

				p1 p1 p2 p3 p3 p3 p3 p3 p3  p3  p3  p4  p4  p4  p4  p5 p5 p5 p5  p5

		turnaround time:
		p1- 2
		p2- 3
		p3- 11
		p4- 15
		p5- 20

		waiting time:
		p1- 0
		p2- 2
		p3- 3
		p4- 11
		p5- 15

		Average waiting time: (0 + 2 + 3 + 11 + 15) / 5 = 6.2

	c. Manually calculate the average waiting time and average response time.
	d. Show the output of your algorithm to ensure correctness.

5. Analysis Results - Using a larger input file (50 processes), show a table which compares the results of all different scheduling algorithms. In addition, for the rr algorithm show a graph of the different analysis measurements as a function of the quantum time. If your own scheduling algorithm has parameters as well, show how they affect the analysis measurements in a graph as well.

6. Conclusion - Which algorithms worked the best and in what cases.

7. An appendix describing which part of the project each team member was in charge of.

8. References - If necessary.
